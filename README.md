# Overview

I created a program that asks the user to select a number of random movie or tv quotes
to be quizzed on. The program will then proceed with the quiz, tracking how many questions
the user gets right. When the quiz is over, the total number of correct questions is shown
and the program terminates on user input.

I wrote this program to introduce myself to Kotlin and become more familiar with the language.

# Development Environment

I used the Intellij Idea IDE.

I used the Kotlin programming language with Gradle and the Gson library.

# Future Work

- Use a more robust list of json quotes.
- Check the accuracy of the quote list.
- Use the year value in the data class.
